# Introduction!

Welcome! It's great to have you here. 

This repo contains a sample project for you to get started on learning more about convolutional neural networks. 

Before you get started, please checkout this [document](./Install.md) to install all of the resources. 

Once you are ready, open this [document](Handwritten_Digit_Recognition.ipynb) and follow along. 

#### Going further

Machine learning is a vast topic. We are only covering a small part of it. If you are interested, I suggest
you check out some resources:

- Towards Data Science has lots of good & short tutorials: https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning/home
- Towards Data Science also has good resources on data science (it's not the same as ML, but related) https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science/home
- A tour of ML algorithms: https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-tour-of-machine-learning-algorithms/
- If you like the math behind neural nets, check out this book online: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/
- Stanford's cs231 is one of the most popular courses on computer vision and ConvNets: http://cs231n.stanford.edu/
- Want to dive deep into computer vision research? Checkout Andrej's new website! https://karpathy.ai/ (He's the Sr. Director of AI @ Tesla)
